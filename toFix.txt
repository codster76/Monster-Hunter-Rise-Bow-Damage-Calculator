For some reason, with the lowest-level mizutsune bow, its charge level 1's damage is inaccurate against the training dummy's head.
Conditions:
Raw: 120
Element: 11
Charge Level: 1
    Raw MV: 9
    Raw Charge Level: 0.65
    Element Charge Level: 0.8
Raw Hitzone: 100
Element Hitzone: 30
No coatings
Normal distance
No additional modifiers

Calculated Damage: 10
Actual Damage: 9

I have confirmed that the error is in the elemental damage. I used dragonheart to cancel my element and the calculations without the element are correct.

Rounding the total element down does not work because it invalidates other calculations.
