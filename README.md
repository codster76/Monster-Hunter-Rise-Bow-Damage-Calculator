# Monster Hunter Rise Bow Damage Calculator
 
This is going to be a calculator for working out damage numbers specifically for bows in Monster Hunter Rise. I'm currently still trying to figure out the formula, but I think I'm close to getting it perfect.

Things I'll be doing for this project:
- Making it usable as a single-page webapp.
- All offensive skills from both Rise and Sunbreak will be included.
- Damage calculations with consideration for every damage source, skill and condition, like enraged states, different hitzones, hunting horn buffs, etc.
- Effective Raw (EFR), Effective Element (EFE) and damage per arrow/hit calculations.

Things I might do if time permits and if I can figure them out:
- Bow and Armour selection.
- Saving sets to local storage.
- Decoration optimiser.
